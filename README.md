## Problema_219

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false

## Problema_220

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]

## Problema_221

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.

## Problema_222

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Example 3:

Input: head = []
Output: []

## Problema_223

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
Example 2:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]

## Problema_224

Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of 
set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:

Input: n = 11

Output: 3

Explanation:

The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

## Problema_225

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

## Problema_226

Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Example 1:

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
